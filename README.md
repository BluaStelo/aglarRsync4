# aglarRsync

A port to Swift of legacy arRsync frontend for macOS

# Origin of project

arRsync was a frontend to rsync command for macOS X written in Objective C by Miles Wu and Adam Watkins.

You may find old sources on SourceForge...

Or on GitHub, here : https://github.com/mileswu/arrsync

Now macOS is evolving, I get warnings app needs to be updated. But it seems original authors have forsaken development since 2011. (Writing those lines in 2018) Swift 4 and Xcode 9 are here. Time to improve that. :)

That's what I'll TRY to do.
